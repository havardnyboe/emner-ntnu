On the channel I found some recodings of Guns N' Roses concerts, and the flag:

I took this picture a few weeks ago. It was so nice that I almost turned around and checked in to the nearby hotel I just passed. Do you know the name of the Hotel? :)

\textbf{Solution:}\\
For this task I first searched on Google maps for riksvei 4 (Rv4), because the map in the car showed that the road was Rv4.

I then searched for hotels along the road, and the first hotel I found was the correct one:
