I do believe I'll be a tail fin hero on Norwegian in 50 years :) I travelled on a plane a few years ago, when I had to create my password, so I used the name on the tail. Here's the hash: 4b57b34a1855d0d9137d36023156717c What was my password?

\textbf{Solution:}\\
I first gathered a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Norwegian_Air_Shuttle_tail_fin_heroes_and_fleet}{list of the names of the people who are on the tail fin of Norwegian's planes}.

Then using hashcat I cracked the hash using the wordlist I created from the list of names.
