Do you want to order a Unicorn?
\\Well, let's try it: \url{http://julie2.hackingarena.no:804}

\textbf{Solution:}\\
First I used the php filter \texttt{php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=index.php} to get the base64 encoded source code of the index.php file.

\end{center}

Then I decoded it and found the following code:

\end{center}

I then looked at the \texttt{/var/www/site/tmp/transfer.log} that was revealed by the source code and found the following stride payment records:

\end{center}

I then when to the \texttt{/order} page and tried to order a unicorn with the card numbers from the stride payment records. But since none of them worked I started looking for example card numbers online and found a list from paypal test credit cards.

I then tried to order a unicorn with the card number \texttt{378282246310005}...
