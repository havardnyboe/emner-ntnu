Ladies and gentlemen, this is the 5th challenge.
\\A little bit of everything...
\\\url{julie.hackingarena.no} port 21000-21500

\textbf{Solution:}\\
First I ran a nmap port scan on the ports 21000-21500, and found a service running on port 21214. I also connected to the service using netcat and found that it was an FTP server.

I then connected to the FTP server annonymously with filezilla and found six files named \texttt{shadow.old}.

Opening the files revealed what looked like some hashed login credentials. I used \url{https://www.dcode.fr/md5-hash} to crack the hashes and found the following credentials:

\begin{alltt}
> shadow.old
lou:Mary
> shadow.old.1
lou:Sandra
> shadow.old.2
lou:Tina
> shadow.old.3
lou:Rita
> shadow.old.4
lou:Monica
> shadow.old.5
lou:Mary
\end{alltt}

Given the six names and the intro text to the task I connected that this was a reference to the song \textit{Mambo No. 5} by Lou Bega. Looking at the chorus of the song I found one of the names that was not used in the hashes, \texttt{Jessica}.

\begin{alltt}
[Chorus]
A little bit of Monica in my life
A little bit of Erica by my side
A little bit of Rita's all I need
A little bit of Tina's what I see
A little bit of Sandra in the sun
A little bit of Mary all night long
A little bit of \textbf{\emph{Jessica}}, here I am
A little bit of you makes me your man (Ha!)
\end{alltt}

I then logged in to the FTP server with the username \texttt{lou} and the password \texttt{Jessica} and found the flag file.

The flag was \texttt{Hacking-Arena\{Everybody\_in\_come\_on\_let's\_flag\}\}}.
