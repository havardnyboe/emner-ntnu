\subsection{Open ports (40p)}
\addtocounter{points}{40}
Check the open ports on julie2.hackingarena.no in the range 6000-7000. What is the sum of the open port numbers? If only port 6000 and 6001 are open, the answer is 12001.

\textbf{Solution:}\\
Using nmap I started a port scan using TCP connect on the range 6000 to 7000, and found four open ports.

Then adding the ports together I got the answer 26632.
