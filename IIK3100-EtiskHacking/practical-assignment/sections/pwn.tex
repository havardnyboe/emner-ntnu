Can you exploit the stack overflow?

\texttt{nc julie.hackingarena.no 821}

\textbf{Solution:}\\
Beginning this task was quite difficult since the binary could not be run on my computer as I was using and M1 Apple Silicon ARM processor.
So I had to switch to a different computer to run the binary.
While running the binary I didn't manage to get the program to return a segmenation fault, or any other error for that matter. But when providing a non-integer input I got the program to start what seemed like an infinite print loop.
