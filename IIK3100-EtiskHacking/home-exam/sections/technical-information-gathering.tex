\subsection{Vipps backoffice (30p)}
Can you find the backoffice website of Vipps? Send the domain as a flag!

\textbf{Solution:}\\
The difficulty in this task was mostly finding a website that could look for and display subdomains without a paywall, since my manual attempts at finding the subdomain failed. I found a website called pentest-tools.com that could do this for me.

After the scan three subdomains were found, and the one that looked most promising was backoffice-test.vipps.no.
