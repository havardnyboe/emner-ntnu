\section{Hash Cracking}
\subsection{Hash 1 (20p)}
I know this guy (lives in Norway) always has his license plate as the password, but I only know the hash: 3c15ee9710f7b56906cb33429d636de6 What's his password?

\textbf{Solution:}\\
Using \texttt{hashcat} this task was pretty simple.
I did a brute force attack with a mask of 2 uppercase letters followed by 5 digits, to match the format of a Norwegian license plate.
The command was \texttt{hashcat -a3 -m0 "3c15ee9710f7b56906cb33429d636de6" "?u?u?d?d?d?d?d"}.

I got the following result:

The password is \texttt{PH76513}.
